# 3D Display Simulation using Head Tracking with Kinect

A C++ application that creates an immersive 3D display experience by tracking the viewer's head position using a Microsoft Kinect sensor. The application adjusts the perspective of 3D rendered content based on the viewer's head position, creating a realistic parallax effect.

## Features

- Real-time head tracking using Microsoft Kinect
- OpenGL-based 3D rendering
- Dynamic perspective adjustment based on viewer position
- Smooth tracking and rendering performance
- Interactive 3D scene visualization

## Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenGL/GLEW/GLUT for 3D rendering
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) for graphics calculations
- Microsoft Kinect SDK
- Microsoft Face Tracking SDK

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Microsoft Kinect for Windows
- Microsoft Kinect SDK
- Microsoft Face Tracking SDK
- Visual Studio (project is configured for VS 2017)
- OpenGL compatible graphics card

## Usage

1. Connect your Kinect sensor
2. Launch the application
3. Position yourself in front of the Kinect sensor
4. Move your head to see the perspective changes in the 3D display
